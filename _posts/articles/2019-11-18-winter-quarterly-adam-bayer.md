At the height of his career as Paris’ most celebrated Art Nouveau illustrator, Alphonse Mucha was driven to create what he, for the remainder of his life, considered his masterpiece, Le Pater.  Both a devout Catholic and deeply-engaged Freemason, Mucha’s objective was to illustrate The Lord’s Prayer as a rich narrative of non-denominational and esoteric symbolism, drawing from Rosicrucian, Masonic, Gnostic and Neoplatonic sources. This lecture aims to deconstruct much of the intent and meaning behind the artist’s endeavor.
