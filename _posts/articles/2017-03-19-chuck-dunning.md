Esoterika Lodge was honored to host C.R. "Chuck" Dunning, Jr, as our
2017 Spring Equinox quarterly lecturer. Bro. Dunning is the author of
*Contemplative Masonry: Basic Applications of Mindfulness, Meditation, and Imagery for the Craft*.
His public lecture was about contemplative practice in Masonry as well
as the basics of contemplative practice for non-Masons. It was
incredibly informative and very well-received.

Bro. Dunning also provided our in-Lodge education. This was a
facilitated contemplative exercise based on Masonic symbolism, and you
really had to be there to understand how meaningful it was.
