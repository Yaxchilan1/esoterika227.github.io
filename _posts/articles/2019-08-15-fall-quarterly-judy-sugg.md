Practices like meditation and yoga are hailed today for their health value, but their meaning and power are far deeper and richer. In yoga, true freedom happens in the place of stillness. In the classical yoga philosophy, what is real is present everywhere, but ignorance of our true nature keeps us separate. This interactive talk focuses on the 2000-year-old compilation of experiments that form the basis of the practices of yoga for higher consciousness.
