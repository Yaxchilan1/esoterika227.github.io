Beautiful, alluring, and cryptic--Celtic Goddesses have captured the imagination of contemporary occultists, sometimes leaving seekers confused by their contradictory nature. By looking at the Goddesses Brigid and The Morrigan through the eyes of the people who first worshipped them, this class will offer context to the mysterious through history, mythology, and modern experience.
