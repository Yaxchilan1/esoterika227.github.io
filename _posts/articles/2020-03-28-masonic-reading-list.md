One of our past masters put together a reading list for Freemasons! If
you're just starting out, or even if you're a salty old brother, you
can find something interesting on his list. [Check it out here!](https://transformason.org/papers/masonic_reading_list.html)

By the way, if you're not a Freemason but you're interested in
learning more, you can find his other article about books for those
who are [just curious about our ancient and mysterious Craft here](https://arnemancy.com/articles/freemasonry/books-about-freemasonry-for-the-curious/).

Mahalo!
