**Our Lodge turned 10!** We decided to mark the occasion with a Table
Lodge. This is an old Masonic tradition that takes the form of a
ritualized dinner. During the ritual, there are special toasts,
lectures, and ceremonies.

The Table Lodge was great fun and was heavily attended. The entire
room was full of Masons celebrating our Tenth Anniversary. Every one
of our Past Masters was present and we were joined by brothers from
seven lodges across three jurisdictions.

Thank you all for helping us celebrate this momentous occasion!
