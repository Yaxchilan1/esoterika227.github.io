# Angel Millar discusses his book, The Three Stages of Initiatic Spirituality: Craftsman, Warrior, Magician

*The Three Stages of Initiatic Spirituality: Craftsman, Warrior, Magician* explores the symbolism, rituals, and metaphysical aspects of each of, and shares meditations, practices, and transformational techniques for, these three initiatic archetypes.

Subjects explored include alchemy, Freemasonry, Kabbalah, Islamic Neoplatonism, martial arts, Taoist inner-alchemy, the Chakras, energy work, Jungian psychology, mind metaphysics, Tantra, sex magic, and modern magic (from Eliphas Levi to Chaos Magic).

An author and speaker on the subjects of self-mastery, self-development, and spirituality, New Dawn magazine describes Angel Millar's work as “...of extraordinary importance in this time of cultural and even spiritual conflict.”
