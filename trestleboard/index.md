We have a peculiar calendar for our Stated meetings.

**In the months of the Solstices and Equinoxes (March, June,
September, and December) we meet on the third Saturday of the month.**
We meet at 5:00pm for light refreshments and a scholarly presentation
open to the public. The presentations are open to all men and women of
good character. The suggested minimum donation for these events is $10
per person. If you are interested in attending or presenting, please

**On the remaining months we meet on the 2nd Wednesday at 7:30pm

short educational lecture along with discussion on Masonic philosophy.

After our meetings, we enjoy libations and fellowship, featuring a
donation bar and an excellent smörgåsbord of cosmic creature cacophony. Prospective members
and others in our community are encouraged [to RSVP](/contact/) to join us for these activities.
