Esoterika Lodge №227, A.F.&amp;A.M. of Oregon is one of the newest Lodges in Oregon. We
were granted a Dispensation in May of 2007 and Constituted in July
of 2008. In May 2017, we
[celebrated our tenth anniversary](/articles/tenth-anniversary-table-lodge/). At
a time when many lodges are consolidating and closing we are thriving!

_Esoterika Lodge is a lodge with a mission._ Our work is focused on

1. providing an exemplary ritual experience to initiates and members, and
2. promoting research and education in Masonic esotericism and history.

To these ends, we confer superlative degrees and
[host quarterly meetings](/trestleboard/) featuring presentations on
topics relevant to Freemasonry and esoteric studies. We have hosted a
series of distinguished speakers, both guests and members of our
lodge.


## Strengthening Freemasonry in Oregon

Our Lodge is dedicated to strengthening Freemasonry in Oregon by
encouraging its members to be the best, most informed Masons
possible. We strive to provide them with the resources and tools they
need.

We are building a community of scholars and ritualists to practice and
explore the often neglected Masonic virtues of prudence and
knowledge. We hope to bolster the Spirit of Freemasonry by celebrating
our history and traditions.

## Visiting Our Lodge

We welcome visitors from any jurisdiction in amity with the Grand
Lodge of Ancient Free & Accepted Masons of Oregon. Esoterika is a
formal Lodge. Members and visitors are expected to conduct themselves
with the gravitas appropriate to members of the oldest and noblest
fraternity in the world. 

Members of Esoterika are expected to wear a dark suit and a white or
black shirt. Visitors from other Lodges are requested to conform to
our dress code as well.

The Lodge is purged prior to the beginning of meetings so Masons from
other lodges and jurisdictions should bring proof of active membership
and be familiar with the necessary signs and tokens.
