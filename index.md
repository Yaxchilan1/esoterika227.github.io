Esoterika Lodge №227, A.F.&amp;A.M. of Oregon is one of the newest Lodges in Oregon. We
were granted a Dispensation in May of 2007 and Constituted in July
of 2008. At a time when many lodges are consolidating and closing we are
thriving!

_Esoterika Lodge is a lodge with a mission._ The work of Esoterika Lodge is focused on

1. perfecting ritual and degree work, and
2. facilitating esoteric and historical studies, research, and scholarship.

To these ends, we confer superlative degrees, and host quarterly
meetings each featuring a scholarly presentation of original research
on a relevant topic. We have been fortunate enough to play host to a
series of distinguished speakers, but are equally proud that many of
our members have given excellent presentations as well.

We are building a community of scholars and ritualists to exemplify
these often neglected Masonic virtues. By so doing, we hope to
generally strengthen, support, and encourage Masonry by highlighting
and
celebrating our glorious history and traditions in a manner as closely
approximating historical accuracy as is permitted by our modern code.

Esoterika is a formal Lodge. Members of Esoterika (and any visiting
bretheren) are expected to conduct themselves with the gravitas
appropriate to members of the oldest and noblest fraternity in the
world. At Lodge meetings, members of Esoterika №227 are expected to
wear at minimum, a dark suit, and a white or black shirt. Visitors from
other Lodges are requested to conform to this as well. Officers of
Esoterika Lodge are requested to wear the official uniform of the lodge
consisting of a black tuxedo tails, white or black shirt and black tie,
with white gloves.

The Lodge is purged prior to the beginning of meetings so Masons from
other Lodges and Jurisdictions should bring proof of active membership
and be familiar with the necessary signs and tokens.
